# Midandpad

## Introduction
An Android MIDI controller



Since Android 6.0 the USB port can be used as a MIDI interface, so a fairly complete controller can be developed with the possibility of expansion with time and patience.

## Download

The app can be downloaded and installed in multiple ways:


* In the [Releases] page
* In the [playstore]
* Downloading and compiling.

(May be in the future in F-Droid, but need some time)

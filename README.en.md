# Midandpad

## Introduction
An Android MIDI controller



Since Android 6.0 the USB port can be used as a MIDI interface, so a fairly complete controller can be developed with the possibility of expansion with time and patience.

Notice that it's a MIDI controller, so it doesn't play any sound. For playing sounds it must be connected to a MIDI synth like Timidity or Fluidsynth.

You can see it in action clicking on the [link to Youtube demo video](https://youtu.be/Ve9VherU25M?feature=shared)
